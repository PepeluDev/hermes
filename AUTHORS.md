Hermes was originally created in 2020 by [Jose Gómez-Sellés](https://github.com/jgomezselles),
as a private tool to make some E/// folks job easier.

Later on, [Pablo Rebaque](https://github.com/hombrenieve) and
[Jorge Hevia](https://github.com/BlackCorsair) added testing, which helped
to maintain and transform the code, and the first seed of the building
environment. This all made it possible to publish this code to Open Source.
Their work and help to make this come true is MUCH APPRECIATED.

Feedback on the tool itself to all E/// colleagues is much appreciated too,
so they are mentioned as AUTHORS too.
